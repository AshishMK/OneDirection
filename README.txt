This project is based on traveling
The main goal of this project is to provide a platform where anyone create a trip or journey and other can join him.

Here how it works
Creating a trip
1-: Here a user can create a trip by creating a rout on the map between starting location and destination location.
2-: He can also set the time when the trip will starts and when trip will ends.
3-: User can also set number of travelers who can join him on the trip
4-: User can also write details or itinerary for the trip.

Joining a Trip
1-: A user can join any trip from "All Trips" List which is sorted by current location of the user i.e. Nearest appears at the top of the trips.
2-: User can see all the details of a trip by selecting it.
3-: User can request for a seat for the trip by tapping on ticket Direction.
4-: User can see owner information on tapping user name.
5-: After requesting a ticket for the trip a "Ticket Request" can be "Accepted" or "Declined" by user.

Other Features
1-: User can see all his trips in My trips section including his own created trips and and other joined trips.
2-: User can comment on a trip.
